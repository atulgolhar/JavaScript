checkSpeed(90);

function checkSpeed(speed) {
  const speedLimit = 70;
  const kmPerPoint = 5;

  if (speed < speedLimit + kmPerPoint) {
    console.log('Ok');
    return;

  const points = Math.floor((speed - speedLimit) / kmPerPoint);
  if (points >= 12)
    console.log('License suspended');
  else
    console.log('Points', points);
}



// LOGIC
// Speed Limit = 70   Ok on console
// for 5 above speed limit -> 1 point   if at 72 still good
// use Math.floor(1.3)  -> 1        Floating Point Numbers
// 
// more than 12 points -> license suspended

// create function checkSpeed
// define a const speedLimit = 70
// tip test your function with different values

// call the function
checkSpeed(70);

function checkSpeed(speed) {
}
// bug speed at 70, add in =

// tip avoid indentation if you can b/c then may need to scroll left right
//     so add a code block {}, move up code into the block, and add a return to
//     jump out of the function thus none of the rest of the code gets executed
//     thus able to delete the else statement, and remove the indentation

/* LOGIC
defined function speed
check if speed is less than 70
display console.log OK
avoid magic number 70
need to define const speedLimit = 70 thus code is more expressive and can use reuse in multiple places
if speed limit changes tomorrow to 75 or 80 then easy change
now calculate points
(speed - speedLimit) / 5 
dont use magic number 5
so turn into a constant
const kmPerPoint = 5
replace magic number with kmPerPoint
use Math.floor and as an argument we pass the expression to calcuate the points
now check to see if driver have more than 12 points
if points >= 12 then suspend licence
otherwise display points on console
change points equation to a const in case we accidently change points
    for example if points++ will give an error
if want to reassign a const then use the let keyword
now lets chek
on top add checkSpeed(50); save changes and we get ok

bug Speed < SpeedLimit should be Speed <= SpeedLimit
solves the bug
try 71 still shows 0 points so still have a bug
speed < speedLimit + kmPerPoint 
this solves it b/c now its 70 + any additional points based upon speed

try 75 should get 1 point
try 77 should still get 1 point
try 80 we should get 2 points
try 60 * 5 above speedlimit means 130 kmPerHour
try 130 works

one last tip
else block causes indentation left right scrolling
need to get rid of else block and the indentation
by adding a return at the if speed < speedLimit + kmPerPoint
we can then remove the else keyword and remove the indentation
