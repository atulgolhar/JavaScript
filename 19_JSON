see myObj as a JSON which is an object
	// OBJECT = name jobbie property hello function
create generic sendJSON variable which contains myObj data which is now a string = "stringified it"
	const sendJSON = JSON.stringify(myObj);
	// STRING = name property inside quotes, no function send. it discards the function
	// can not access function using dot notation b/c its a string

	const receiveJSON = JSON.parse(sendJSON);	
	// parse the string and turn back into an object
	//can yes access function b/c its a object, but no method
	// so we lose any method along the way
