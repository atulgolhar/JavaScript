// Conditionals: If statements

// Syntax

if (condition) { 
    // run 1st block of code
} else if {
    // run different 2nd block of code 
} else {
    // run 3rd block of code
}

// Conditionals: If statements

let soup = "chicken noodle soup";

} else {

// keep soup variable to execute if statement
// delete soup variable to execute else statement


// logical order of if statement drives this

// now add boolean to see if Customer is banned
